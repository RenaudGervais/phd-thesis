## Abstract
### Motivation: Why do we care about the problem and the results?
Most of our waking hours are now spent staring at a screen. While the advances in touch screens has enabled the use of more expressiveness by using our fingers to interact with digital content, what we see and manipulate on screen is still an emulation of real-world metaphors. The range of capabilities of the human senses are much richer that what screens can currently offer. In order to be sustainable in the future, interaction with the digital world should leverage these human capabilities instead of letting them atrophy. One way to provide richer interaction modalities is to rely on the physical world itself as an host for digital content. Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) provides a technical mean towards this idea by using projectors to shed digitally controlled light onto real-world objects to augment them and their environment with functionalities and content. Tangible User Interfaces (TUI), a type of interfaces investigating the use of physical objects as input and output of digital information are often found alongside SAR.

### Problem statement: What problem are your trying to solve?
How to interact with projected content when hosted on tangible objects? 

### Approach: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product?

### Results: What's the answer?

### Conclusions: What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (of of the previous results are useful)?
