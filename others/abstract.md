- Motivation: Why do we care about the problem and the results?
- Problem statement: What problem are your trying to solve?
- Approach: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product?
- Results: What's the answer?
- Conclusions: What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (of of the previous results are useful)?
