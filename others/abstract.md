# Abstract

## Motivation: Why do we care about the problem and the results?
Most of our waking hours are now spent staring at a screen. While the advances in touch screens has enabled the use of more expressiveness by using our fingers to interact with digital content displayed on screen. However, what we see and manipulate on screen is still an emulation of real-world metaphors. The range of capabilities of the human senses are much richer that what screens can currently offer.

## Problem statement: What problem are your trying to solve?
## Approach: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product?
## Results: What's the answer?
## Conclusions: What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (of of the previous results are useful)?
