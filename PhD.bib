  abstract = {In this paper we present a new technique and prototype graph visualization
	system, stereoscopic highlighting, to help answer accessibility and
	adjacency queries when interacting with a node-link diagram. Our
	technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to highlight regions of interest
	in a 2D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the
	viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify
	specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail
	without resorting to other highlighting techniques like color or
	motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes.
	This mechanism of stereoscopic highlighting also enables focus+context
	views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with
	the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly
	less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled
	experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual highlighting
	to stereoscopic highlighting on 2D and 3D graph layouts for a range
	of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference
	in performance between stereoscopic highlighting alone and static
	visual highlighting is not statistically significant, users performed
	better when both highlighting methods were used concurrently. In
	more complicated tasks, 3D layout with static visual highlighting
	outperformed 2D layouts with a single highlighting method. However,
	it did not outperform the 2D layout utilizing both highlighting techniques
	simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic
	highlighting is a promising technique that can significantly enhance
	graph visualizations for certain use cases.},

  abstract = {Current software tools for visualization of spatio-temporal data,
	on the one hand, utilize the opportunities provided by modern computer
	technologies, on the other hand, incorporate the legacy from the
	conventional cartography. We have considered existing visualization-based
	techniques for exploratory analysis of spatio-temporal data from
	two perspectives: (1) what types of spatio-temporal data they are
	applicable to; (2) what exploratory tasks they can potentially support.
	The technique investigation has been based on an operational typology
	of spatio-temporal data and analytical tasks we specially devised
	for this purpose. The result of the study is a structured inventory
	of existing exploratory techniques related to the types of data and
	tasks they are appropriate for. This result is potentially helpful
	for data analystsusers of geovisualization tools: it provides guidelines
	for selection of proper exploratory techniques depending on the characteristics
	of data to analyze and the goals of analysis. At the same time the
	inventory as well as the suggested typology of tasks could be useful
	for tool designers and developers of various domain-specific geovisualization
	applications. The designers can, on the one hand, see what task types
	are insufficiently supported by the existing tools and direct their
	creative activities towards filling the gaps, on the other hand,
	use the techniques described as basic elements for building new,
	more sophisticated ones. The application developers can, on the one
	hand, use the task and data typology in the analysis of potential
	user needs, on the other hand, appropriately select and combine existing
	tools in order to satisfy these needs.},

	Twenty-three participants verbally estimated ten distances between

	at the same time. Additionally, the presence of a metric aid was

	complaints (e.g., headache), the experience in the virtual world
	(e.g., presence), and the experiment itself (self-evaluation of the
	estimations). Results show that participants underestimate the virtual
	distances but are able to perceive the distances in the right metric
	order even when only very simple virtual environments are presented.
	Furthermore, interindividual differences and intraindividual stabilities
	can be found among participants, and neither the three different
	virtual environments nor the metric aid improved depth estimations.
	Estimation performance is better in peripersonal than in extrapersonal
	space. In contrast, subjective ratings provide a preferred space:

  abstract = {The object of this study is to mathematically specify important characteristics
	of visual flow during translation of the eye for the perception of
	depth and self-motion. We address various strategies by which the
	central nervous system may estimate self-motion and depth from motion
	parallax, using equations for the visual velocity field generated
	by translation of the eye through space. Our results focus on information
	provided by the movement and deformation of three-dimensional objects
	and on local flow behavior around a fixated point. All of these issues
	are addressed mathematically in terms of definite equations for the
	optic flow. This formal characterization of the visual information
	presented to the observer is then considered in parallel with other
	sensory cues to self-motion in order to see how these contribute
	to the effective use of visual motion parallax, and how parallactic
	flow can, conversely, contribute to the sense of self-motion. This
	article will focus on a central case, for understanding of motion
	parallax in spacious real-world environments, of monocular visual
	cues observable during pure horizontal translation of the eye through
	a stationary environment. We suggest that the global optokinetic
	stimulus associated with visual motion parallax must converge in
	significant fashion with vestibular and proprioceptive pathways that
	carry signals related to self-motion. Suggestions of experiments
	to test some of the predictions of this study are made.},

	paper affirming the importance of this powerful concept, reinforcing
	Norman's distinctions of terminology, and expanding on the usefulness
	of the concepts in terms of their application to interaction design
	and evaluation. We define and use four complementary types of affordance
	in the context of interaction design and evaluation: cognitive affordance,
	physical affordance, sensory affordance, and functional affordance.
	The terms cognitive affordance (Norman's perceived affordance) and
	physical affordance (Norman's real affordance) refer to parallel
	and equally important usability concepts for interaction design,
	to which sensory affordance plays a supporting role. We argue that
	the concept of physical affordance carries a mandatory component
	of utility or purposeful action (functional affordance). Finally,
	we provide guidelines to help designers think about how these four
	kinds of affordance work together naturally in contextualized HCI
	design or evaluation. },

  abstract = {Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) support the heart in its vital task
	of maintaining circulation in the human body when the heart alone
	is not able to maintain a sufficient flow rate due to illness or
	degenerative diseases. However, the engineering of these devices
	is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer
	simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such
	a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper
	we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed
	to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage
	prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles
	through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can
	be computed. The model's tensor output approximates a single blood
	cell's deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar
	data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons,
	particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques
	are accessible through a Virtual Reality-based user interface, which
	features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction
	with the complex three-dimensional data. To illustrate the effectiveness
	of these visualization methods, we present the results of an analysis
	session that was performed by domain experts for a specific data
	set for the MicroMed DeBakey VAD.},

  title = {{A less-is-more approach to geovisualization - enhancing knowledge

  journal = {International Journal of Geographical Information Science},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {23},
  pages = {1077--1093},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {The less-is-more concept in interface design for computer applications
	has recently gained ground. In this article, the concept is adopted
	for a user-centered design of geovisualization application. The premise
	is that using simple and clear design can lead to successful applications
	with improved ease of use. Over the last three decades, the development
	of GIS and geovisualization has seen a marked increase in the levels
	of interaction between the user, the system and the information.
	However, these enthusiastic advances in technology have not resulted
	in a significant increase in the number of users. This article suggests
	that types of user interaction should not simply emphasize traditional
	GIS functions such as zooming and panning but move towards interaction
	based on facilitating the knowledge construction process. Considerations
	are made for the complexity of the system, the task at hand and the
	skills and limitations of the users. These elements are particularly
	important when maps act as the mediators in collaboration with users
	across disciplinary backgrounds. In such cases, the emphasis on simplicity
	and usability becomes as important as functionality. In these situations
	a geovisualization application designed for specific uses can maximize
	effective development of geographic knowledge. In this article, a
	minimalistic design approach to geovisualization is adopted by creating
	a geographic profiling tool which shifts the emphasis from technological
	advances or interaction with the map to the interaction elements
	key to building the spatial knowledge of GIS experts and non-experts
	alike. To evaluate this notion of less-is-more geovisualization the
	profiling tool is evaluated according to usability matrices: efficiency,
	effectiveness and learnability. How well the Suburban Profiler contributes
	to these elements is assessed by conducting a video analysis of the
	types and forms of user interaction available. The video analysis
	demonstrates the usefulness and usability of the Suburban Profiler,
	providing proof of concept for less-is-more geovisualization.},

  abstract = {We present Drawing on Air, a haptic-aided input technique for drawing
	controlled 3D curves through space. Drawing on Air addresses a control
	problem with current 3D modeling approaches based on sweeping movement
	of the hands through the air. While artists praise the immediacy
	and intuitiveness of these systems, a lack of control makes it nearly
	impossible to create 3D form beyond quick design sketches or gesture
	drawings. Drawing on Air introduces two new strategies for more controlled
	3D drawing: one-handed drag drawing and two-handed tape drawing.
	Both approaches have advantages for drawing certain types of curves.
	We describe a tangent preserving method for transitioning between
	the two techniques while drawing. Haptic-aided redrawing and line
	weight adjustment while drawing are also supported in both approaches.
	In a quantitative user study evaluation by illustrators, the one
	and two-handed techniques performed at roughly the same level, and
	both significantly outperformed freehand drawing and freehand drawing
	augmented with a haptic friction effect. We present the design and
	results of this experiment as well as user feedback from artists
	and 3D models created in a style of line illustration for challenging
	artistic and scientific subjects.},

	artist-scientist-technologist collaboration in designing multivariate,
	virtual reality (VR) visualizations. Design study 1 identifies the
	promise of 3D drawing-style interfaces for VR design and also establishes
	limitations of these tools with respect to precision and support
	for animation. Design study 2 explores animating artist-created visualization
	designs with scientific 3D fluid flow data. While results captured
	an accurate sense of flow that was advantageous as compared to the
	results of study 1, the potential for visual exploration using the
	design tools tested was limited. Design study 3 reveals the importance
	of a new 3D interface that overcomes the precision limitation found
	in study 1 while remaining accessible to artist collaborators. Drawing
	upon previous results, design study 4 engages collaborative teams
	in a design process that begins with traditional paper sketching
	and moves to animated, interactive, VR prototypes "sketched" by designers
	in VR using interactive 3D tools. Conclusions from these four studies
	identify important characteristics of effective artist-accessible
	VR visualization design tools and lead to a proposed formalized methodology
	for successful collaborative design that we expect to be useful in
	guiding future collaborations. We call this proposed methodology
	Scientific Sketching.},

  abstract = {Volume visualization has been widely used for decades for analyzing
	datasets ranging from 3D medical images to seismic data to paleontological
	data. Many have proposed using immersive virtual reality (VR) systems
	to view volume visualizations, and there is anecdotal evidence of
	the benefits of VR for this purpose. However, there has been very
	little empirical research exploring the effects of higher levels
	of immersion for volume visualization, and it is not known how various
	components of immersion influence the effectiveness of visualization
	in VR. We conducted a controlled experiment in which we studied the
	independent and combined effects of three components of immersion
	(head tracking, field of regard, and stereoscopic rendering) on the
	effectiveness of visualization tasks with two x-ray microscopic computed
	tomography datasets. We report significant benefits of analyzing
	volume data in an environment involving those components of immersion.
	We find that the benefits do not necessarily require all three components
	simultaneously, and that the components have variable influence on
	different task categories. The results of our study improve our understanding
	of the effects of immersion on perceived and actual task performance,
	and provide guidance on the choice of display systems to designers
	seeking to maximize the effectiveness of volume visualization applications.},

	between brain regions. In experienced meditators (13 Tibetan Buddhists,
	15 {QiGong}, 14 Sahaja Yoga, 14 Ananda Marga Yoga, 15 Zen), 19-channel
	{EEG} was recorded before, during and after that meditation exercise
	which their respective tradition regards as route to the most desirable
	meditative state. The head surface {EEG} data were recomputed ({sLORETA)}
	into 19 cortical regional source model time series. All 171 functional
	connectivities between regions were computed as 'lagged coherence'
	for the eight {EEG} frequency bands (delta through gamma). This analysis
	removes ambiguities of localization, volume conduction-induced inflation
	of coherence, and reference-dependence. All significant differences
	(corrected for multiple testing) between meditation compared to no-task
	rest before and after meditation showed lower coherence during meditation,
	in all five traditions and eight (inhibitory as well as excitatory)
	frequency bands. Conventional coherence between the original head
	surface {EEG} time series very predominantly also showed reduced
	coherence during meditation. The topography of the functional connectivities
	was examined via {PCA-based} computation of principal connectivities.
	When going into and out of meditation, significantly different connectivities
	revealed clearly different topographies in the delta frequency band
	and minor differences in the beta-2 band. The globally reduced functional
	interdependence between brain regions in meditation suggests that
	interaction between the self process functions is minimized, and
	that constraints on the self process by other processes are minimized,
	thereby leading to the subjective experience of non-involvement,
	detachment and letting go, as well as of all-oneness and dissolution
	of ego borders during meditation.},

	optimal psychophysiological state. A dynamic systems view of the
	interrelations between psychological, cognitive and emotional systems
	and neural communication networks in the human organism provides
	a foundation for the view presented. These communication networks
	are examined from an information processing perspective and reveal
	a fundamental order in heart-brain interactions and a harmonious
	synchronization of physiological systems associated with positive
	emotions. The concept of coherence is drawn on to understand optimal
	functioning which is naturally reflected in the heart’s rhythmic
	patterns. Research is presented identifying various psychophysiological
	states linked to these patterns, with neurocardiological coherence
	emerging as having significant impacts on well being. These include
	psychophysiological as well as improved cognitive performance. From
	this, the central role of the heart is explored in terms of biochemical,
	biophysical and energetic interactions. Appendices provide further
	details and research on; psychophysiological functioning, reference
	previous research in this area, details on research linking coherence
	with optimal cognitive performance, heart brain synchronization and
	the energetic signature of the various psychophysiological modes.},

	is sustained attention or tonic alertness. This usage of vigilance
	implies both the degree of arousal on the sleep-wake axis and the
	level of cognitive performance. There are many interacting neural
	and neurotransmitter systems that affect vigilance. Most studies
	of vigilance have relied on states where the sleep-wake state is
	altered, e.g. drowsiness, sleep-deprivation, and CNS-active drugs,
	but there are factors ranging from psychophysics to motivation that
	may impact vigilance. While EEG is the most commonly studied physiologic
	measure of vigilance, various measures of eye movement and of autonomic
	nervous system activity have also been used. This review paper discusses
	the underlying neural basis of vigilance and its assessment using
	physiologic tools. Since, assessment of vigilance requires assessment
	of cognitive function this aspect is also discussed.},

	mono, where stimuli were displayed as flat, 2-D images, and stereo,
	where objects were displayed with stereoscopic depth information.
	In three experiments, participants performed a sequential matching
	task, where an object was rotated by up to 180 degrees between presentations.
	When the 180 degrees rotation resulted in large changes in depth
	for object components, recognition performance in the mono condition
	showed better performance at 180 degrees rotations than at smaller
	rotations, but stereo presentations showed a monotonic increase in
	response time with rotation. However, 180 degrees rotations that
	did not result in much depth variation showed similar patterns of
	results for mono and stereo conditions. These results suggest that
	in some circumstances, the lack of explicit 3-D information in 2-D
	images may influence the recognition of familiar objects when they
	are depicted on flat computer monitors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We provide a review and analysis of much of the published
	literature on visual perception issues that impact the design and
	use of head-mounted displays (HMDs). BACKGROUND: Unlike the previous
	literature on HMDs, this review draws heavily from the basic vision
	literature in order to help provide insight for future design solutions
	for HMDs. METHOD: Included in this review are articles and books
	found cited in other works as well as articles and books obtained
	from an Internet search. RESULTS: Issues discussed include the effect
	of brightness and contrast on depth of field, dark focus, dark vergence,
	and perceptual constancy; the effect of accommodation-vergence synergy
	on perceptual constancy, eyestrain, and discomfort; the relationship
	of field of view to the functioning of different visual pathways
	and the types of visual-motor tasks mediated by them; the relationship
	of binocular input to visual suppression; and the importance of head
	movements, head tracking, and display update lag. CONCLUSION: This
	paper offers a set of recommendations for the design and use of HMDs.
	APPLICATION: Consideration of the basic vision literature will provide
	insight for future design solutions for HMDs.},

  abstract = {Spatial judgments are important for many real-world tasks in engineering
	and scientific visualization. While existing research provides evidence
	that higher levels of display and interaction fidelity in virtual
	reality systems offer advantages for spatial understanding, few investigations
	have focused on small-scale spatial judgments or employed experimental
	tasks similar to those used in real-world applications. After an
	earlier study that considered a broad analysis of various spatial
	understanding tasks, we present the results of a follow-up study
	focusing on small-scale spatial judgments. In this research, we independently
	controlled field of regard, stereoscopy, and head-tracked rendering
	to study their effects on the performance of a task involving precise
	spatial inspections of complex 3D structures. Measuring time and
	errors, we asked participants to distinguish between structural gaps
	and intersections between components of 3D models designed to be
	similar to real underground cave systems. The overall results suggest
	that the addition of the higher fidelity system features support
	performance improvements in making small-scale spatial judgments.
	Through analyses of the effects of individual system components,
	the experiment shows that participants made significantly fewer errors
	with either an increased field of regard or with the addition of
	head-tracked rendering. The results also indicate that participants
	performed significantly faster when the system provided the combination
	of stereo and head-tracked rendering.},

	Since the interactivity of geovisualization is so critical to its
	utility, there is currently a need for new methods to capture and
	make use of this rich set of interactions. This paper describes Re-Visualization,
	a method that can capture and re-use analysis sessions. Low-level
	state changes are collected during analysis and saved into sessions.
	These sessions can then be replayed in a way that allows users to
	review and explore their interactions. During analysis, users can
	leave breadcrumbs behind that mark portions of the analysis for follow-up.
	We outline design guidelines for a toolkit called ReVise that implements
	Re-Visualization. Finally, we describe our substantial progress toward
	implementing ReVise in the Improvise visualization environment.},

  abstract = { Abstract Projection mapping is a group of techniques for projecting
	imagery onto physical three-dimensional objects in order to augment
	the object or space with digital content. Most projection mapping
	experiences and events are non-interactive, partly because of the
	many inherent design problems in designing for interaction is such
	situations. This article explores one approach to this tricky issue
	by analysing a group of four interactive mixed reality experiences
	that combine projection mapping with camera-based interaction techniques.
	The approaches used are described, and their deployment in a variety
	of situations is analysed using engagement and play theories. The
	works suggest that some projection mapping techniques can be used
	in the service of creating engaging interactive exhibits and installations,
	but that the effectiveness of the approach relies on it placing the
	experience and interactions clearly in our own physical world, rather
	than behind a screen or in an artificial image space. },

	we asked participants to search a computer-generated virtual room

	or with visual information supplemented with body-based information
	for all movement (walk group) or rotational movement (rotate group).
	The walk group performed the task with near-perfect efficiency, irrespective
	of whether a rich or impoverished visual scene was provided. The
	visual-only and rotate groups were significantly less efficient and
	frequently searched parts of the room at least twice. These results
	suggest that full physical movement plays a critical role in navigational
	search, but only moderate visual detail is required.},

	(simple reaction time measurement, concentration performance, figure

	test, producing a graduated increase in spectral power density in
	delta and theta frequency range on the EEG in the fronto-temporal,
	parietal and occipital regions of the cortex and a generalized decrease
	in alpha power. During the rest periods after each test a graduated
	increase in alpha 1 power was seen as a possible expression of change
	in vigilance level. With this method we were able to differentiate
	two effects of psychometric tests on brain activity: the actual mental
	demand itself and the influence on the vigilance level.},

	Commission on Visualization and Virtual Environment working group
	on Cognitive and Usability Issues in Geovisualization. Developments
	in hardware and software have led to (and will continue to stimulate)
	novel methods for visualizing geospatial data. It is our belief that
	these novel methods will be of little use if they are not developed
	within a theoretical cognitive framework and iteratively tested using
	usability engineering principles. We argue that cognitive and usability
	issues should be considered in the context of six major research
	themes: 1) geospatial virtual environments (GeoVEs), 2) dynamic representations
	(including animated and interactive maps), 3) metaphors and schemata
	in user interface design, 4) individual and group differences, 5)
	collaborative geovisualization, and 6) evaluating the effectiveness
	of geovisualization methods. A key point underlying our use of theoretical
	cognitive principles is that traditional cognitive theory for static
	2D maps may not be applicable to interactive 3D immersive GeoVEs
	and dynamic representations thus new cognitive theory may need to
	be developed. Usability engineering extends beyond the traditional
	cartographic practice of ?user testing? by evaluating software effectiveness
	throughout a lifecycle (including design, development, and deployment).
	Applying usability engineering to geovisualization, however, may
	be problematic because of the novelty of geovisualization and the
	associated difficulty of defining the nature of users and their tasks.
	Tackling the research themes is likely to require an interdisciplinary
	effort involving geographic information scientists, cognitive scientists,
	usability engineers, computer scientists, and others.},

	tools in architectural and urban design processes. The reason why
	designers still use physical models remains unclear. In addition,
	physical and 3D virtual models have yet to be differentiated. The
	answers to these questions are too complex to account for in all
	aspects. Thus, this study only focuses on the differences in spatial
	understanding between physical and virtual models. In particular,
	it emphasizes on the perception of scale. For our experiment, respondents
	were shown a physical model and a virtual model consecutively. A
	questionnaire was then used to ask the respondents to evaluate these
	models objectively and to establish which model was more accurate
	in conveying object size. Compared with the virtual model, the physical
	model tended to enable quicker and more accurate comparisons of building
	heights. },

	in the performance of computer-stimulated and 'real world' versions
	of an interactive depth perception task. The availability of depth
	cues (disparity, accommodation, luminance, and texture) was manipulated.
	Results indicate that ability to perceive depth using binocular cues
	is not associated with ability to perceive depth using monocular
	cues. Further, ability to integrate cues was a strong correlate of
	depth perception when multiple cues were available, and appeared
	more important in this respect than ability to use individual depth
	cues. Correlations between psychometric measures of fluid intelligence/spatial
	ability and depth perception were generally weak, but consistent
	with the broader pattern of results, suggesting that individual differences
	in depth perception should currently be regarded as 'cue specific'.
	Hypothesized facilitative effects of paradoxical monocular stereopsis
	were not found.},

	3D user interfaces (3DUIs) but differs from the general-purpose input
	hardware typically found in research labs and commercial applications.
	Despite this, no one has systematically evaluated the device in terms
	of what it offers 3DUI designers. Experience with the Wiimote indicates
	that it's an imperfect harbinger of a new class of spatially convenient
	devices, classified in terms of spatial data, functionality, and
	commodity design. This tutorial presents techniques for using the
	Wiimote in 3DUIs. It discusses the device's strengths and how to
	compensate for its limitations, with implications for future spatially
	convenient devices.},

  abstract = {Cognitive monitoring is an approach utilizing realtime brain signal
	decoding (RBSD) for gaining information on the ongoing cognitive
	user state. In recent decades this approach has brought valuable
	insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated RBSD
	can be used to set up a brain-computer interface (BCI) providing
	a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain
	activity. In BCIs the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands
	to control the connected computer system or to communicate through
	it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing
	BCI technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information
	about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional
	states to the technical system. We call this approach passive BCI.
	In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive
	BCI, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from
	BCI technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users,
	and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since
	the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with BCI
	technology is very similar to the concept of BCIs itself we propose
	a unifying categorization of BCI-based applications, including the
	novel approach of passive BCI.},

	The core technique in our system is an algorithm for simulating the
	tissue vaporization process by laser heating. Different from classical
	volume CSG operations, our technique takes experimental data as the
	guidance to determine the vaporization amount so that only a specified
	amount of tissue is vaporized in each time. Our algorithm uses a
	predictor-corrector strategy. First, we apply the classical CSG algorithm
	on a tetrahedral grid based distance field to estimate the vaporized
	tissue amount. Then, a volume-correction phase is applied on the
	distance field. To improve the performance, we further propose optimization
	approaches for efficient implementation.},
