  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a new technique and prototype graph visualization system, stereoscopic highlighting, to help answer accessibility and adjacency queries when interacting with a node-link diagram. Our technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to highlight regions of interest in a 2D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail without resorting to other highlighting techniques like color or motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes. This mechanism of stereoscopic highlighting also enables focus+context views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual highlighting to stereoscopic highlighting on 2D and 3D graph layouts for a range of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference in performance between stereoscopic highlighting alone and static visual highlighting is not statistically significant, users performed better when both highlighting methods were used concurrently. In more complicated tasks, 3D layout with static visual highlighting outperformed 2D layouts with a single highlighting method. However, it did not outperform the 2D layout utilizing both highlighting techniques simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic highlighting is a promising technique that can significantly enhance graph visualizations for certain use cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Current software tools for visualization of spatio-temporal data, on the one hand, utilize the opportunities provided by modern computer technologies, on the other hand, incorporate the legacy from the conventional cartography. We have considered existing visualization-based techniques for exploratory analysis of spatio-temporal data from two perspectives: (1) what types of spatio-temporal data they are applicable to; (2) what exploratory tasks they can potentially support. The technique investigation has been based on an operational typology of spatio-temporal data and analytical tasks we specially devised for this purpose. The result of the study is a structured inventory of existing exploratory techniques related to the types of data and tasks they are appropriate for. This result is potentially helpful for data analystsusers of geovisualization tools: it provides guidelines for selection of proper exploratory techniques depending on the characteristics of data to analyze and the goals of analysis. At the same time the inventory as well as the suggested typology of tasks could be useful for tool designers and developers of various domain-specific geovisualization applications. The designers can, on the one hand, see what task types are insufficiently supported by the existing tools and direct their creative activities towards filling the gaps, on the other hand, use the techniques described as basic elements for building new, more sophisticated ones. The application developers can, on the one hand, use the task and data typology in the analysis of potential user needs, on the other hand, appropriately select and combine existing tools in order to satisfy these needs.},

EEG is identified as a physiological index that can serve as an online, continuous measure of cognitive load detecting subtle fluctuations in instantaneous load, which can help explain effects of instructional interventions when measures of overall cognitive load fail to reflect such differences in cognitive processing. This paper presents a review of seminal literature on the use of continuous EEG to measure cognitive load and describes two case studies on learning from hypertext and multimedia that employed EEG methodology to collect and analyze cognitive load data.},

Twenty-three participants verbally estimated ten distances between 40 cm and 500 cm in three different virtual environments in two conditions: (1) only one target was presented or (2) ten targets were presented at the same time. Additionally, the presence of a metric aid was varied. A questionnaire assessed subjective ratings about physical complaints (e.g., headache), the experience in the virtual world (e.g., presence), and the experiment itself (self-evaluation of the estimations). Results show that participants underestimate the virtual distances but are able to perceive the distances in the right metric order even when only very simple virtual environments are presented. Furthermore, interindividual differences and intraindividual stabilities can be found among participants, and neither the three different virtual environments nor the metric aid improved depth estimations. Estimation performance is better in peripersonal than in extrapersonal space. In contrast, subjective ratings provide a preferred space: a closed room with visible floor, ceiling, and walls.},

A between-group design was used, and 40 volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions (stereoscopy vs. no stereoscopy) and to one of two emotional VEs (relaxation or joy). The participants' emotions were assessed before and after the VR experience. Presence was measured with two postexperiment questionnaires (ITC-SOPI and SUS). Results show that there were no differences between stereoscopic and monoscopic presentations in VEs (neither subjective sense of presence nor emotional reactions). Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed herein.},

  Abstract                 = {Object recognition suffers when objects are rotated-in-depth, as for example with changes to viewing angle. However the loss of recognition can be mitigated by stereoscopic cues, suggesting that object coding is not strictly two-dimensional. Here we consider whether the encoding of rotation-in-depth (RID) of a simple curve is tuned for stereoscopic depth. Experiment 1 first determined that test subjects were sensitive to changes in stereoscopic RID, by showing that stereoscopic cues improved the discrimination of RID when other spatial cues to RID were ineffective. Experiment 2 tested directly whether curvature-sensitive mechanisms were selective for stereoscopic RID. Curvature after-effects were measured for unrotated test curves following adaptation to various RID adaptors. Although strong adaptation tuning for RID angle was found, tuning was identical for stereo and non-stereo adaptors. These findings show that while stereoscopic cues can facilitate three-dimensional curvature discrimination, curvature-sensitive mechanisms are not tuned for stereoscopic RID.},

In the first three experiments, we used a sequential matching task in which observers matched the identities of shaded tube-like objects. Across Experiments 1-3, we manipulated the presentation method of the nonstereo stimuli (having observers wear an eye patch vs. showing observers the same screen image) and the magnitude of the viewpoint change (30 degrees vs. 38 degrees). In Experiment 4, observers identified "easy" and "hard" rotating wire-frame objects at the individual level under stereo and nonstereo viewing conditions. We found a stereo advantage for generalizing to unfamiliar views in all the experiments. However, in these experiments, performance remained view dependent even under stereo viewing. These results strongly argue against strictly 2-D image-based models of object recognition, at least for the stimuli and recognition tasks used, and suggest that observers used representations that contained view-specific local depth information.},

In contrast, geographic visualization environments and related geographic information technologies have been built and assessed only for use by individuals. In this paper, we describe a prototype same-time/different-place collaborative geovisualization environment designed to explore issues of collaborative visualization. Next, we outline an approach to understanding use and usability and present results of interviews with domain experts about the ways in which geovisualization might enable collaboration. Finally, we present goals for futher research.},

  Abstract                 = { In reaction to Norman's (1999) essay on misuse of the term affordance in human-computer interaction literature, this article is a concept paper affirming the importance of this powerful concept, reinforcing Norman's distinctions of terminology, and expanding on the usefulness of the concepts in terms of their application to interaction design and evaluation. We define and use four complementary types of affordance in the context of interaction design and evaluation: cognitive affordance, physical affordance, sensory affordance, and functional affordance. The terms cognitive affordance (Norman's perceived affordance) and physical affordance (Norman's real affordance) refer to parallel and equally important usability concepts for interaction design, to which sensory affordance plays a supporting role. We argue that the concept of physical affordance carries a mandatory component of utility or purposeful action (functional affordance). Finally, we provide guidelines to help designers think about how these four kinds of affordance work together naturally in contextualized HCI design or evaluation. },

At such an important milestone, the author takes the opportunity to comment on the state of the field: where we've been, where we are, and what comes next. Our challenge as a research community is to deliver on information visualization's promise. The most interesting results in an applied field such as information visualization come from helping to solve our customers and sponsors' real problems. To create the future, we need close interactions and exchanges with our customers. The Information Visualization Symposium started 10 years ago because some of us recognized a need to apply scientific visualization ideas to a new user base, in which an analyst, rather than a scientist, was the target user. The opportunity is even better today than it was then.},

  Abstract                 = {The distinctiveness of clinical environments demands specific solutions in the design of both usable and practical user interfaces for 3D medical imaging. In this work, a novel user interface to provide a direct interaction in 3D space by off-the-shelf input devices is proposed. The interface, which has been implemented and integrated into an open-source medical image viewer, features a depth-enhanced mouse pointer and a novel rotation technique that uses the object's geometry as the rotation handle. The usability of the proposed approach is evaluated to show its effectiveness for use in professional 3D imaging applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The object of this study is to mathematically specify important characteristics of visual flow during translation of the eye for the perception of depth and self-motion. We address various strategies by which the central nervous system may estimate self-motion and depth from motion parallax, using equations for the visual velocity field generated by translation of the eye through space. Our results focus on information provided by the movement and deformation of three-dimensional objects and on local flow behavior around a fixated point. All of these issues are addressed mathematically in terms of definite equations for the optic flow. This formal characterization of the visual information presented to the observer is then considered in parallel with other sensory cues to self-motion in order to see how these contribute to the effective use of visual motion parallax, and how parallactic flow can, conversely, contribute to the sense of self-motion. This article will focus on a central case, for understanding of motion parallax in spacious real-world environments, of monocular visual cues observable during pure horizontal translation of the eye through a stationary environment. We suggest that the global optokinetic stimulus associated with visual motion parallax must converge in significant fashion with vestibular and proprioceptive pathways that carry signals related to self-motion. Suggestions of experiments to test some of the predictions of this study are made.},

  Abstract                 = {Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) support the heart in its vital task of maintaining circulation in the human body when the heart alone is not able to maintain a sufficient flow rate due to illness or degenerative diseases. However, the engineering of these devices is a highly demanding task. Advanced modeling methods and computer simulations allow the investigation of the fluid flow inside such a device and in particular of potential blood damage. In this paper we present a set of visualization methods which have been designed to specifically support the analysis of a tensor-based blood damage prediction model. This model is based on the tracing of particles through the VAD, for each of which the cumulative blood damage can be computed. The model's tensor output approximates a single blood cell's deformation in the flow field. The tensor and derived scalar data are subsequently visualized using techniques based on icons, particle visualization, and function plotting. All these techniques are accessible through a Virtual Reality-based user interface, which features not only stereoscopic rendering but also natural interaction with the complex three-dimensional data.

  Abstract                 = {The less-is-more concept in interface design for computer applications has recently gained ground. In this article, the concept is adopted for a user-centered design of geovisualization application. The premise is that using simple and clear design can lead to successful applications with improved ease of use. Over the last three decades, the development of GIS and geovisualization has seen a marked increase in the levels of interaction between the user, the system and the information. However, these enthusiastic advances in technology have not resulted in a significant increase in the number of users. This article suggests that types of user interaction should not simply emphasize traditional GIS functions such as zooming and panning but move towards interaction based on facilitating the knowledge construction process. Considerations are made for the complexity of the system, the task at hand and the skills and limitations of the users. These elements are particularly important when maps act as the mediators in collaboration with users across disciplinary backgrounds. In such cases, the emphasis on simplicity and usability becomes as important as functionality. In these situations a geovisualization application designed for specific uses can maximize effective development of geographic knowledge. In this article, a minimalistic design approach to geovisualization is adopted by creating a geographic profiling tool which shifts the emphasis from technological advances or interaction with the map to the interaction elements key to building the spatial knowledge of GIS experts and non-experts alike. To evaluate this notion of less-is-more geovisualization the profiling tool is evaluated according to usability matrices: efficiency, effectiveness and learnability. How well the Suburban Profiler contributes to these elements is assessed by conducting a video analysis of the types and forms of user interaction available. The video analysis demonstrates the usefulness and usability of the Suburban Profiler, providing proof of concept for less-is-more geovisualization.},

  Abstract                 = {We present Drawing on Air, a haptic-aided input technique for drawing controlled 3D curves through space. Drawing on Air addresses a control problem with current 3D modeling approaches based on sweeping movement of the hands through the air. While artists praise the immediacy and intuitiveness of these systems, a lack of control makes it nearly impossible to create 3D form beyond quick design sketches or gesture drawings. Drawing on Air introduces two new strategies for more controlled 3D drawing: one-handed drag drawing and two-handed tape drawing. Both approaches have advantages for drawing certain types of curves. We describe a tangent preserving method for transitioning between the two techniques while drawing. Haptic-aided redrawing and line weight adjustment while drawing are also supported in both approaches. In a quantitative user study evaluation by illustrators, the one and two-handed techniques performed at roughly the same level, and both significantly outperformed freehand drawing and freehand drawing augmented with a haptic friction effect. We present the design and results of this experiment as well as user feedback from artists and 3D models created in a style of line illustration for challenging artistic and scientific subjects.},

Design study 1 identifies the promise of 3D drawing-style interfaces for VR design and also establishes limitations of these tools with respect to precision and support for animation. Design study 2 explores animating artist-created visualization designs with scientific 3D fluid flow data. While results captured an accurate sense of flow that was advantageous as compared to the results of study 1, the potential for visual exploration using the design tools tested was limited. Design study 3 reveals the importance of a new 3D interface that overcomes the precision limitation found in study 1 while remaining accessible to artist collaborators. Drawing upon previous results, design study 4 engages collaborative teams in a design process that begins with traditional paper sketching and moves to animated, interactive, VR prototypes "sketched" by designers in VR using interactive 3D tools. Conclusions from these four studies identify important characteristics of effective artist-accessible VR visualization design tools and lead to a proposed formalized methodology for successful collaborative design that we expect to be useful in guiding future collaborations. We call this proposed methodology Scientific Sketching.},

  Abstract                 = {Volume visualization has been widely used for decades for analyzing datasets ranging from 3D medical images to seismic data to paleontological data. Many have proposed using immersive virtual reality (VR) systems to view volume visualizations, and there is anecdotal evidence of the benefits of VR for this purpose. However, there has been very little empirical research exploring the effects of higher levels of immersion for volume visualization, and it is not known how various components of immersion influence the effectiveness of visualization in VR. We conducted a controlled experiment in which we studied the independent and combined effects of three components of immersion (head tracking, field of regard, and stereoscopic rendering) on the effectiveness of visualization tasks with two x-ray microscopic computed tomography datasets. We report significant benefits of analyzing volume data in an environment involving those components of immersion. We find that the benefits do not necessarily require all three components simultaneously, and that the components have variable influence on different task categories. The results of our study improve our understanding of the effects of immersion on perceived and actual task performance, and provide guidance on the choice of display systems to designers seeking to maximize the effectiveness of volume visualization applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain functional states are established by functional connectivities between brain regions. In experienced meditators (13 Tibetan Buddhists, 15 {QiGong}, 14 Sahaja Yoga, 14 Ananda Marga Yoga, 15 Zen), 19-channel {EEG} was recorded before, during and after that meditation exercise which their respective tradition regards as route to the most desirable meditative state. The head surface {EEG} data were recomputed ({sLORETA)} into 19 cortical regional source model time series. All 171 functional connectivities between regions were computed as 'lagged coherence' for the eight {EEG} frequency bands (delta through gamma). This analysis removes ambiguities of localization, volume conduction-induced inflation of coherence, and reference-dependence. All significant differences (corrected for multiple testing) between meditation compared to no-task rest before and after meditation showed lower coherence during meditation, in all five traditions and eight (inhibitory as well as excitatory) frequency bands. Conventional coherence between the original head surface {EEG} time series very predominantly also showed reduced coherence during meditation. The topography of the functional connectivities was examined via {PCA-based} computation of principal connectivities. When going into and out of meditation, significantly different connectivities revealed clearly different topographies in the delta frequency band and minor differences in the beta-2 band. The globally reduced functional interdependence between brain regions in meditation suggests that interaction between the self process functions is minimized, and that constraints on the self process by other processes are minimized, thereby leading to the subjective experience of non-involvement, detachment and letting go, as well as of all-oneness and dissolution of ego borders during meditation.},

  Abstract                 = {Now available in paperback for the first time, this classic work presents a cognitive-semiotic framework for understanding how maps work as powerful, abstract, and synthetic spatial representations. Explored are the ways in which the many representational choices inherent in mapping interact with information processing and knowledge construction, and how the resulting insights can be used to make informed symbolization and design decisions. A new preface to the paperback edition situates the book within the context of contemporary technologies. As the nature of maps continues to evolve, Alan MacEachren emphasizes the ongoing need to think systematically about the ways people interact with and use spatial information.},

A dynamic systems view of the interrelations between psychological, cognitive and emotional systems and neural communication networks in the human organism provides a foundation for the view presented. These communication networks are examined from an information processing perspective and reveal a fundamental order in heart-brain interactions and a harmonious synchronization of physiological systems associated with positive emotions. The concept of coherence is drawn on to understand optimal functioning which is naturally reflected in the heart’s rhythmic patterns. Research is presented identifying various psychophysiological states linked to these patterns, with neurocardiological coherence emerging as having significant impacts on well being. These include psychophysiological as well as improved cognitive performance. From this, the central role of the heart is explored in terms of biochemical, biophysical and energetic interactions. Appendices provide further details and research on; psychophysiological functioning, reference previous research in this area, details on research linking coherence with optimal cognitive performance, heart brain synchronization and the energetic signature of the various psychophysiological modes.},

  Abstract                 = {Vigilance is a term with varied definitions but the most common usage is sustained attention or tonic alertness. This usage of vigilance implies both the degree of arousal on the sleep-wake axis and the level of cognitive performance. There are many interacting neural and neurotransmitter systems that affect vigilance. Most studies of vigilance have relied on states where the sleep-wake state is altered, e.g. drowsiness, sleep-deprivation, and CNS-active drugs, but there are factors ranging from psychophysics to motivation that may impact vigilance. While EEG is the most commonly studied physiologic measure of vigilance, various measures of eye movement and of autonomic nervous system activity have also been used. This review paper discusses the underlying neural basis of vigilance and its assessment using physiologic tools. Since, assessment of vigilance requires assessment of cognitive function this aspect is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We tested recognition of familiar objects in two different conditions: mono, where stimuli were displayed as flat, 2-D images, and stereo, where objects were displayed with stereoscopic depth information. In three experiments, participants performed a sequential matching task, where an object was rotated by up to 180 degrees between presentations. When the 180 degrees rotation resulted in large changes in depth for object components, recognition performance in the mono condition showed better performance at 180 degrees rotations than at smaller rotations, but stereo presentations showed a monotonic increase in response time with rotation. However, 180 degrees rotations that did not result in much depth variation showed similar patterns of results for mono and stereo conditions. These results suggest that in some circumstances, the lack of explicit 3-D information in 2-D images may influence the recognition of familiar objects when they are depicted on flat computer monitors.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We provide a review and analysis of much of the published literature on visual perception issues that impact the design and use of head-mounted displays (HMDs). BACKGROUND: Unlike the previous literature on HMDs, this review draws heavily from the basic vision literature in order to help provide insight for future design solutions for HMDs. METHOD: Included in this review are articles and books found cited in other works as well as articles and books obtained from an Internet search. RESULTS: Issues discussed include the effect of brightness and contrast on depth of field, dark focus, dark vergence, and perceptual constancy; the effect of accommodation-vergence synergy on perceptual constancy, eyestrain, and discomfort; the relationship of field of view to the functioning of different visual pathways and the types of visual-motor tasks mediated by them; the relationship of binocular input to visual suppression; and the importance of head movements, head tracking, and display update lag. CONCLUSION: This paper offers a set of recommendations for the design and use of HMDs. APPLICATION: Consideration of the basic vision literature will provide insight for future design solutions for HMDs.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial judgments are important for many real-world tasks in engineering and scientific visualization. While existing research provides evidence that higher levels of display and interaction fidelity in virtual reality systems offer advantages for spatial understanding, few investigations have focused on small-scale spatial judgments or employed experimental tasks similar to those used in real-world applications. After an earlier study that considered a broad analysis of various spatial understanding tasks, we present the results of a follow-up study focusing on small-scale spatial judgments. In this research, we independently controlled field of regard, stereoscopy, and head-tracked rendering to study their effects on the performance of a task involving precise spatial inspections of complex 3D structures. Measuring time and errors, we asked participants to distinguish between structural gaps and intersections between components of 3D models designed to be similar to real underground cave systems. The overall results suggest that the addition of the higher fidelity system features support performance improvements in making small-scale spatial judgments. Through analyses of the effects of individual system components, the experiment shows that participants made significantly fewer errors with either an increased field of regard or with the addition of head-tracked rendering. The results also indicate that participants performed significantly faster when the system provided the combination of stereo and head-tracked rendering.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the analytical power of geographic visualization, it remains difficult for users of these tools to save, re-use, or re-visit what they have discovered. Most current systems are limited to providing screen captures and can only save basic data and layout settings. Since the interactivity of geovisualization is so critical to its utility, there is currently a need for new methods to capture and make use of this rich set of interactions. This paper describes Re-Visualization, a method that can capture and re-use analysis sessions. Low-level state changes are collected during analysis and saved into sessions. These sessions can then be replayed in a way that allows users to review and explore their interactions. During analysis, users can leave breadcrumbs behind that mark portions of the analysis for follow-up. We outline design guidelines for a toolkit called ReVise that implements Re-Visualization. Finally, we describe our substantial progress toward implementing ReVise in the Improvise visualization environment.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Projection mapping is a group of techniques for projecting imagery onto physical three-dimensional objects in order to augment the object or space with digital content. Most projection mapping experiences and events are non-interactive, partly because of the many inherent design problems in designing for interaction is such situations. This article explores one approach to this tricky issue by analysing a group of four interactive mixed reality experiences that combine projection mapping with camera-based interaction techniques. The approaches used are described, and their deployment in a variety of situations is analysed using engagement and play theories. The works suggest that some projection mapping techniques can be used in the service of creating engaging interactive exhibits and installations, but that the effectiveness of the approach relies on it placing the experience and interactions clearly in our own physical world, rather than behind a screen or in an artificial image space. },

  Abstract                 = {During navigation, humans combine visual information from their surroundings with body-based information from the translational and rotational components of their movement. Theories of navigation focus on the role of visual and rotational body-based information, even though experimental evidence shows they are not sufficient for complex spatial tasks. To investigate the contribution of all three sources of information, we asked participants to search a computer-generated virtual room for targets. Participants were provided with only visual information or with visual information supplemented with body-based information for all movement (walk group) or rotational movement (rotate group). The walk group performed the task with near-perfect efficiency, irrespective of whether a rich or impoverished visual scene was provided. The visual-only and rotate groups were significantly less efficient and frequently searched parts of the room at least twice. These results suggest that full physical movement plays a critical role in navigational search, but only moderate visual detail is required.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to investigate the activation process of the central nervous system during mental demand in a complex psychophysiological situation. A 17-channel quantitative topographical EEG was recorded in 48 healthy volunteers (male and female, aged 49 +/- 6 years), using the CATEEM system, during four different psychometric tests (simple reaction time measurement, concentration performance, figure detection and word recall test). The mental load varied with each test, producing a graduated increase in spectral power density in delta and theta frequency range on the EEG in the fronto-temporal, parietal and occipital regions of the cortex and a generalized decrease in alpha power. During the rest periods after each test a graduated increase in alpha 1 power was seen as a possible expression of change in vigilance level. With this method we were able to differentiate two effects of psychometric tests on brain activity: the actual mental demand itself and the influence on the vigilance level.},

  Abstract                 = {We provide a research agenda for the International Cartographic Association?s Commission on Visualization and Virtual Environment working group on Cognitive and Usability Issues in Geovisualization. Developments in hardware and software have led to (and will continue to stimulate) novel methods for visualizing geospatial data. It is our belief that these novel methods will be of little use if they are not developed within a theoretical cognitive framework and iteratively tested using usability engineering principles. We argue that cognitive and usability issues should be considered in the context of six major research themes: 1) geospatial virtual environments (GeoVEs), 2) dynamic representations (including animated and interactive maps), 3) metaphors and schemata in user interface design, 4) individual and group differences, 5) collaborative geovisualization, and 6) evaluating the effectiveness of geovisualization methods. A key point underlying our use of theoretical cognitive principles is that traditional cognitive theory for static 2D maps may not be applicable to interactive 3D immersive GeoVEs and dynamic representations thus new cognitive theory may need to be developed. Usability engineering extends beyond the traditional cartographic practice of ?user testing? by evaluating software effectiveness throughout a lifecycle (including design, development, and deployment). Applying usability engineering to geovisualization, however, may be problematic because of the novelty of geovisualization and the associated difficulty of defining the nature of users and their tasks. Tackling the research themes is likely to require an interdisciplinary effort involving geographic information scientists, cognitive scientists, usability engineers, computer scientists, and others.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the digital age, physical models are still used as major tools in architectural and urban design processes. The reason why designers still use physical models remains unclear. In addition, physical and 3D virtual models have yet to be differentiated. The answers to these questions are too complex to account for in all aspects. Thus, this study only focuses on the differences in spatial understanding between physical and virtual models. In particular, it emphasizes on the perception of scale. For our experiment, respondents were shown a physical model and a virtual model consecutively. A questionnaire was then used to ask the respondents to evaluate these models objectively and to establish which model was more accurate in conveying object size. Compared with the virtual model, the physical model tended to enable quicker and more accurate comparisons of building heights. },

  Abstract                 = {Improvise is a fully-implemented system in which users build and browse multiview visualizations interactively using a simple shared-object coordination mechanism coupled with a flexible, expression-based visual abstraction language. By coupling visual abstraction with coordination, users gain precise control over how navigation and selection in a visualization affects the appearance of data in individual views. As a result, it is practical to build visualizations with more views and richer coordination in Improvise than in other visualization systems. Building and browsing activities are integrated in a single, live user interface that lets users alter visualizations quickly and incrementally during data exploration.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports an experimental study of individual differences in the performance of computer-stimulated and 'real world' versions of an interactive depth perception task. The availability of depth cues (disparity, accommodation, luminance, and texture) was manipulated. Results indicate that ability to perceive depth using binocular cues is not associated with ability to perceive depth using monocular cues. Further, ability to integrate cues was a strong correlate of depth perception when multiple cues were available, and appeared more important in this respect than ability to use individual depth cues. Correlations between psychometric measures of fluid intelligence/spatial ability and depth perception were generally weak, but consistent with the broader pattern of results, suggesting that individual differences in depth perception should currently be regarded as 'cue specific'. Hypothesized facilitative effects of paradoxical monocular stereopsis were not found.},

Despite this, no one has systematically evaluated the device in terms of what it offers 3DUI designers. Experience with the Wiimote indicates that it's an imperfect harbinger of a new class of spatially convenient devices, classified in terms of spatial data, functionality, and commodity design. This tutorial presents techniques for using the Wiimote in 3DUIs. It discusses the device's strengths and how to compensate for its limitations, with implications for future spatially convenient devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive monitoring is an approach utilizing realtime brain signal decoding (RBSD) for gaining information on the ongoing cognitive user state. In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated RBSD can be used to set up a brain-computer interface (BCI) providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In BCIs the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing BCI technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive BCI. In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive BCI, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from BCI technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with BCI technology is very similar to the concept of BCIs itself we propose a unifying categorization of BCI-based applications, including the novel approach of passive BCI.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we introduce a novel application of volume modeling techniques on laser Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) therapy simulation. The core technique in our system is an algorithm for simulating the tissue vaporization process by laser heating. Different from classical volume CSG operations, our technique takes experimental data as the guidance to determine the vaporization amount so that only a specified amount of tissue is vaporized in each time. Our algorithm uses a predictor-corrector strategy. First, we apply the classical CSG algorithm on a tetrahedral grid based distance field to estimate the vaporized tissue amount. Then, a volume-correction phase is applied on the distance field. To improve the performance, we further propose optimization approaches for efficient implementation.},
