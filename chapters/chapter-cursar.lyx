In the previous chapters, we have discussed the idea that augmented physical
 objects could be an interesting way to mesh together digital capabilities
 while remaining anchored in the physical world, which our bodies and minds
 inhabit everydays.
 However, this raises the question on how content for these mixed reality
 objects will be created and 
\emph on
interacted
\emph default
 with.
 While technical issues related to the augmentation of objects are being
 solved progressively, the problems related to interaction remain largely
 unexplored.
 A central concept in interaction is the ability to select an element or
 position.
 In this chapter, we investigate the question of pointing -- more specifically
 using standard 2D pointing devices, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 -- in a SAR context.

Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) consists in projecting digital information
 directly onto physical objects.
 Beyond conventional display methods based on monitor screens or planar
 projections, this approach opens new perspectives in numerous fields including
 design, education and mediation.
 Since the pioneering work of Raskar et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, inherent problems of computer vision and computer graphics are being solved
 today.
 On the other hand, the problems related to interaction remain largely unexplore
d.
 In this work, we have investigated the question of pointing in SAR.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many components to interaction.
 A fundamental one consists in pointing.
 Several strategies to point at augmented objects exist.
 When the augmented content is visualized using a multitouch device, via
 video see-through, it is possible to leverage the touch surface to point
 at a target, as is done in Vincent et al.'s work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Vincent2013"

\end_inset

.
 Regarding pointing on 
\emph on
tangible 
\emph default
augmented objects, one option is to touch directly the area of interest.
 Technological means to achieve precise touch detection on physical object
 are becoming mature and versatile.
 For example, the field of OUIs -- see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:intro-oui"

\end_inset

 for an overview -- envisions everyday objects covered by thin film diplays
 which are multitouch.

\begin_layout Standard
Direct touch, as an approach, is very straightforward and, consequently,
 it may be valuable in many contexts.
 However, it suffers from many drawbacks.
 In particular, anatomical issues such as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat finger
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem and the fatigue that is linked to mid-air interaction make direct
 touch little adapted as soon as accurate and prolonged actions are required
 (e.g.
 professional object design).
 In addition, direct touch is not possible when dealing with very fragile
 objects (e.g.
 relics in museums) or as soon as the objects are out of reach.
 For distant interaction, laser pointers or virtual rays can be good alternative
s, but they still suffer from similar accuracy and fatigue issues.
 This motivated our approach to consider the use of standard pointing devices,
 namely mice and graphics tablets, to point at augmented objects.
 One of the thing we had in mind is the creation of hybrid applications
 -- as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cursar-teaser-drawing"

\end_inset

.
 These applications could leverage both the power and flexibility of professiona
l tools, currently hosted on traditional computing platforms, and the real
 world surrounding these platforms.
 Years of human-computer interaction (HCI) have shown that mice and graphic
 tablets are decidedly well suited to point at visual objects displayed
 on 2D screens.
 Our assumption is that they can benefit to SAR as well, as soon as precision
 or prolonged work is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example, we can imagine an inspection scenario where an engineer points
 at an augmented circuit board with a mouse to highlight defects on small
 components.
 Another example is a design scenario where the artist draws by way of a
 graphics tablet on a physical object, e.g.
 a 3D-printed one, to give it a specific appearance.
 For these two scenarios, it is interesting to note that the user equipped
 with a standard pointing device is still able to interact efficiently with
 standard GUI components displayed on a traditional screen, opening the
 way to true hybrid applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pointing from mice and tablets has been extensively studied in traditional
 HCI contexts.
 In particular, Fitts' law

 is able to predict the speed at which a user will be able to select a target
 depending on its distance and its size.
 Other works have been dedicated to pointing in 3D stereoscopic contexts

.
 The current work is the first one that studies the question of pointing
 in SAR, from standard pointing devices.
 In this work, we are interested in a setup where the user is sitting at
 a desk (desktop environment) and is interacting with objects located in
 front of him or her, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:cursar-teaser"

\end_inset

.
 Our contribution is the evaluation of the performance of pointing in a
 SAR environment using a standard pointing device compared to a traditional
 screen-based setup.

 interacted with stereoscopic SAR using a mix of tangibles and gestures.
 These systems aimed for interaction modalities close to real-world metaphors.
 However, while perhaps more natural, they might prove to be less suited
 for precise and prolonged work than traditional 2D input devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of pointing in SAR is similar to pointing in other contexts,
 namely multi-display environments (MDEs) and stereoscopic displays.
 In some ways, SAR can be compared to MDEs in that the physical world acts
 like a continuous space comprised of small display surfaces.
 As with MDEs, SAR might have some blind spots where the cursor will disappear
 because of a lack of projection support.

 consists in projecting a cursor that can slide on any surface of the environmen

 However, the system has been designed as a way to give feedback on the
 cursor's position when transitioning between screens and no targets were
 located in the environment itself in their evaluation.
 Pointing on a stereoscopic display has been studied by Teather and Stuerzlinger

.
 They studied different cursor types in what is effectively a ‚Äú2.5D‚Äù, or
 projected pointing task using a 3D Fitts' law pointing task.
 We also used projected pointing in this study.
 However, working on a real-world canvas is different from working on a
 screen since the real-world does not provide any reference frame for the
 2D interaction.
 Moreover, a SAR installation does not suffer from the vergence-accommodation
 conflict present when using stereoscopic screens.
 Closer to a SAR setup, Reikimoto and Saitoh 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 content across different surfaces and objects.
 However, the pointing activity was not studied.

\begin_layout Section
Pointing in SAR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our SAR environment is comprised of a static scene laid out on a table in
 front of the user.
 A projector is then used to augment the objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a standard screen configuration, the mouse cursor is generally represented
 as an arrow moving on the screen plane.
 When a 3D scene is displayed, the user is able to select any visible part
 of this virtual scene by picking the rendered result at the cursor location
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cursar-virtual-pointing"

\end_inset

).
 Since most people are already experienced with this way of pointing, we
 wanted to know if this technique could be ported to a SAR environment albeit
 the lack of a physical screen support.
 Therefore, we used exactly the same metaphor in SAR, with the difference
 that the 3D scene is physically there, while the screen plane becomes virtual.
 The user moves the cursor on this virtual plane as he or she would do with
 a physical screen, as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cursar-setup"

\end_inset

.
 A line representing the intersection between the virtual plane and the
 table is projected onto the table, and an arrow indicates the horizontal
 position of the cursor -- see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cursar-teaser"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cursar-setup"

\end_inset

 (C item).
 Contrary to standard screen configurations where the cursor is displayed
 on the screen plane, our SAR cursor is displayed directly on the physical
 objects.
 This cursor is represented as a cross within a 2D circle that is aligned
 with the underlying surface.
 Technically, we cast a ray formed by the eye and cursor position on the
 virtual plane towards the scene.
 We then position the cursor perpendicularly to the normal of the picked
 point.
 The visual feedback (line and arrows) helps to know where the cursor is
 as soon as the latter does not project onto an object.

User Study
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conducted a user study to assess the performance of the pointing technique
 described in the previous section (SAR) in comparison to a screen-based
 baseline (SCREEN).
 Our research question was the following: What is the difference in performance
 of a pointing task realized on a screen compared to one realized with a
 SAR installation given that all other conditions are constant? Does pointing
 in SAR follows Fitts' law?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Participants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sixteen participants took part in the study (12 males, 4 females, mean age
 28.75, SD 4.71).
 All of them obtained a university degree.
 Six participants were left-handed (the mouse used during the experiment
 was adapted to both left- and right-handed users).
 All the participants were familiar with mice, whereas they had very little
 experience with tablets.
 None of them had previous experience with SAR systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Apparatus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scene to be augmented was laid out on a table in front of the user.
 Each object of the scene was manually measured and modeled in 3D.
 A projector was located above and behind the user pointing at the scene.
 The projector was calibrated using OpenCV's camera calibration functions.
 We used a 3.6 GHz Core i7 PC with Windows 8 equipped with two GeForce GTX690
 graphic boards.
 The videoprojector was a ViewSonic Pro9000 with a resolution of 1920√ó1080
 pixels.
 The same setup was used for both SAR and SCREEN conditions.
 In SAR, the virtual scene was projected directly onto the physical objects
 whereas a white wooden surface located at the same position was used in
 the SCREEN condition.
 This ensured a similar frame rate (50 FPS), colorimetric configuration
 (color, brightness, contrast) and approximately same pixel size in both
 conditions.
 The focus of the videoprojector was set on the screen plane.
 On this plane, the resolution was effectively of 915√ó904 pixels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the SAR condition, the objects were augmented by reprojecting the virtual
 scene from the point of view of the projector.
 In the SCREEN condition, the viewpoint of the user on the scene was virtually
 reproduced and reprojected on the virtual counterpart of the physical screen.
 Then, this reprojection was rendered from the point-of-view of the projector,
 effectively making the viewed scene in both conditions identical, as shown
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cursar-sar-screen"

\end_inset

.
 We did not use real-time head tracking but the user head's position was
 measured manually and thus accounted for.
 The whole installation has been created using the creative coding framework
 vvvv.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the input device, we used both a mouse (MOUSE) and a Wacom Cintiq 13HD
 tablet (TABLET).
 The screen of the tablet was not used for the experiment and therefore
 was displaying a black viewport.
 The button located on the pen was used for the selection action.
 The mouse was used in a relative mode while an absolute mapping was associated
 with the tablet.
 The acceleration transfer function of the mouse was disabled.

 shape with comparable dimensions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:cursar-teaser"

\end_inset

).
 The scene onto which the targets to acquire were laid out varied by rotating
 the cube by an angle of 45¬∫ to provide more depth changes between trials.
 The participants sat at a distance of 1 m from the screen or physical objects,
 and the height of the chair was set in order for the participants' head
 to be located at the ideal observer position.

Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We followed the procedure described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "MacKenzie1992"

\end_inset

.
 The participants had first to position the cursor in a home area represented
 by a red circle.
 After one second, this circle moved from red to green and a target appeared
 in the scene.
 The participants were instructed to select this target as quickly and accuratel
y as possible.
 The start time was recorded when the cursor left the home area and stopped
 when the users clicked on the target.
 The targets were spread on a circle centered on the home area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used a 2√ó2 within-subjects design.
 The independent variables were the output modality (SCREEN, SAR) and the
 input modality (MOUSE, TABLET).
 The dependent variables were the completion time, the inefficiency defined
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Path_{actual}-Path_{optimal}}{Path_{optimal}}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhai2004"

\end_inset

 and the number of errors, defined as the number of selections outside the
 target area.
 For each condition, the participants had to acquire 40 targets, resulting
 in 160 target acquisitions by participant, and 2560 records in total.
 The order for the input and output were counter balanced following a latin
 square to avoid any learning effects.

Results and Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the homogeneity of variance couldn't be verified according to Levene's
 test (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$

), we analyzed our data with non-parametric statistics, using multiple Wilcoxon
 signed-rank tests and false rate discovery correction.
 We retained trials which did not comprise errors to study time and inefficiency
 across our factors.
 Statistical results are reported in Table

Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no significant effect of the input device on completion time.
 However, output modality had a significant impact.
 Users were 11% faster in the SCREEN condition compared to the SAR condition.
 While having higher completion time, the drop in performance is relatively
 low, especially considering that the cursor reference frame was virtual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inefficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inefficiency is a measure of ‚Äúwasted‚Äù cursor movement by the user.
 Input modality had a significant effect, the tablet being more inefficient
 than the mouse.
 This difference can be explained by the lack of experience of almost all
 participants with such a tablet.
 Output did not have a clear significant effect on the inefficency of the
 movements of the users.
 When looking at Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:cursar-heatmap"

\end_inset

 one can observe that the participants tend to follow similar strategies
 for reaching the target.
 In both cases, straight lines are drawn, independently of the underlying
 background (2D flat screen or physical 3D objects).

 was discretised from

 to

\end_inset

 by steps of 0.5.
 We averaged the completion time across 
\begin_inset Formula $ID$
\end_inset

 and conditions (input
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

output).
 We modeled the movement time (
\begin_inset Formula $MT$
\end_inset

) with a linear regression.
 We obtained an adjusted 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 value of 0.8479 which shows that the completion time of pointing tasks in
 SAR using mice and tablets still follows the Fitts' law (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cursar-fitts"

\end_inset

), and consequently remains predictable.
 We also computed associated measures of performance, also known as ‚Äúthroughput‚Äù
, using the slope of the regression lines.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Throughput=\frac{1}{b}$

\begin_layout Standard
There was no significant effect of the input device on the throughput, whereas
 output device did have an effect.
 The screen condition was significantly more efficient than the SAR condition
 although, as it was the case for the completion time, the difference is
 relatively low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the participants were slightly less efficient in the SAR condition
 than the SCREEN one.
 This difference could be explained by the years of experience of the participan
ts with pointing in front of a screen whereas they were exposed to a SAR
 setup for the first time.
 Also, it is interesting that removing the physical reference frame (screen)
 of the cursor does not prevent users to interact in the same way they are
 used to, i.e.
 as if a physical screen was there.
 We can thus presume that with additional experience, participants may improve
 their performance with SAR.
 Another possible cause for the drop of performance is the presence of blind
 spots where the cursor disappear because of a lack of projection support
 (such zones were involved in about 1/4 of the trials).
 It could be interesting to compare the effect of these gaps in MDEs vs
 SAR to evaluate the impact of the frame of reference provided by the screen.
 Additionally, possible extensions of this work include studying the performance
 when moving the viewpoint of the user while using the Perspective Cursor

 and evaluating if the performance drop observed in the SAR condition can
 be reproduced with other interaction techniques such as laser-pointer.

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We presented an approach for interacting with desktop SAR, i.e.
 when the user interacts with physical objects in front of him/her by way
 of standard pointing devices.
 A user study has shown that Fitts' law remains valid even if no physical
 screen is present.
 Users are able to point at targets displayed on the augmented objects in
 a manner that is comparable to what they used to do in front of a standard
 screen.
 This finding opens interesting perspectives, allowing desktop SAR applications
 to be used to extend the current desktop setup with augmented physical
 objects.
